        <h2>What is Global Warming?</h2>
        <p>Global warming refers to the long-term rise in Earth's average temperature due to human activities like deforestation, fossil fuel burning, and other pollution. This leads to climate change, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events.</p>
        <h2>Causes of Global Warming</h2>
        <p>
            Burning of Fossil Fuels (Coal, Oil, Natural Gas)<br>
            Deforestation<br>
            Industrial Emissions<br>
            Agricultural Practices<br>
            Waste Management
        </p>
        <h2>Effects of Global Warming</h2>
        <p>The impact of global warming is evident in rising sea levels, melting glaciers, intense heatwaves, and more frequent storms. These changes threaten ecosystems, biodiversity, and human livelihoods.</p>
